            <p>HCIL was the first company where I felt embraced as a foreingner. With them, I could inmerse myself into the Irish community and culture. After a while I noticed that I had become a local member of my neighborhood. This first work as healthcare worker in the Irish healthcare was a bit challenge as there are quite a few differences from my country to Ireland, but in general, those differences were overcame as soon as I got used to the system </p>
